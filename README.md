# Examples of Data Repositories using Spring Data JPA, DeltaSpike Data and QueryDSL.

This project was derived from [https://github.com/mstahv/jpa-helper-libraries](https://github.com/mstahv/jpa-helper-libraries)

Using Data Repositories provided an architecturally sound way of implementing a data layer.

This example project introduces the audience to, [Spring Data JPA](http://projects.spring.io/spring-data-jpa), its plain CDI cousin [DeltaSpike Data](https://deltaspike.apache.org/documentation/data.html) and [QueryDSL](http://www.querydsl.com). 
The example app contains three EJB different implementations for simple phonebook CRUD and shows how the tools can help to implement them.

The project has separate modules for [JPA Entities](data-entities) and implementations using [Spring Data JPA](spring-data), [DeltaSpike Data](delta-spike-data) and [QueryDSL](querydsl-data).
Unit Tests have been added to each of the modules.
The [Web layer](vaadin-web) is built using [vaadin](https://vaadin.com/).

## Importing into Eclipse
* Create a new workspace.
* Open Shell and change directory to the workspace folder.
* Execute
```
git clone https://github.com/Jozi-JUG/data-repositories.git
```
* In Eclipse Select File -> Import -> Maven -> Existing Maven Projects.
* Select the workspace folder/data-repositories
* You should see the project and a list of sub projects.
* Click Finish and wait a while because Maven will have to resolve a lot of dependencies.

If you want to cut down on the wait time in Eclipse you can build the project on the commandline first.  
```
mvn install -DskipTests
```
## Building Maven project in Eclipse
* Select data-repositories project
* Right-Click and Select Run As -> Maven Build...
* Enter 'install' into Goals
* Click Run

The Maven build will execute the unit tests as well.  
In order to execute the unit tests in Eclipse locate the Test classes under src/test/java packages.  
Select the test and right-click and select Run As -> JUnit Test.

## Executing Vaadin UI in Eclipse
* Select data-repositories project
* Right-Click and Select Run As -> Maven Build...
* Enter '--projects vaadin-web wildfly:run' into Goals
* Click Run

The container will be launched and program deployed.
